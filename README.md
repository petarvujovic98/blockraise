# BlockRaise

Decentralized crowdfunding platform leveraging blockchain technology, aiming to
enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in the fundraising process.

## Problem Statement

In the broader context of web3, founders struggle to raise funds for their
project and there is no such platform to support various backers to fund
projects. Traditional crowdfunding platforms face issues related to lack of
transparency, high fees, and susceptibility to fraud. Centralized control
hinders trust, and project creators often face challenges with fund distribution
and accountability.

## Solution Overview

Implement a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform that utilizes smart contracts
to automate and secure the fundraising process. The use of blockchain ensures
transparency, reduces intermediaries, and enhances trust among backers and
project creators.
